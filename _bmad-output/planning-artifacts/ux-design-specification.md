---

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision

Oja is a budget-first shopping mobile app that transforms grocery shopping from an anxiety-inducing guessing game into a controlled, confident experience. The core innovation is simple but profound: know your total before entering the store, not after.

Unlike traditional shopping apps that are glorified notepads, Oja combines:
- **Stock tracking** that auto-populates lists (you never forget essentials)
- **Budget simulation** that shows your total in real-time
- **Receipt intelligence** that learns actual prices for better estimates
- **Emotional UX** that makes staying under budget feel like winning, not restricting

The platform is a Native Mobile App (Expo) targeting UK shoppers.

### Target Users

**Primary Personas:**

1. **Sarah (Anxious Overspender)** - Needs to feel in control without feeling deprived. Success metric: walks out under budget and feels empowered.

2. **Marcus (Sceptical New User)** - Expects to delete the app within a week. Needs frictionless onboarding (<90 seconds) with immediate value (pre-populated pantry).

3. **Priya (Power User)** - Shopping is precision operation. Needs advanced features (impulse fund, shopping mode) without cluttering the basic experience.

4. **James (Tech-Struggling)** - Not tech-savvy, needs forgiving UX with graceful recovery from mistakes and no dead ends.

5. **David (Data-Focused)** - Dislikes flashy apps. Values clean data presentation over celebration. Test case for "mature gamification."

### Key Design Challenges

1. **Budget Visualization** - The "Safe Zone" glow must reduce anxiety, not create it. Color transitions (green → amber → red) need to feel informative, not alarming.

2. **Stock Level Interaction** - Tap-and-hold with liquid drain animation must feel satisfying enough to encourage regular updates. This is the pantry's stickiness factor.

3. **Receipt Scanning Flow** - Camera → OCR → AI parsing is technically complex. UX must hide complexity while maintaining user control over corrections.

4. **Onboarding Friction** - Pre-seeded products + budget dial must deliver "ready to shop" feeling in under 90 seconds. Any more and Marcus deletes.

5. **Offline Trust** - Users in stores with poor connectivity must feel confident their data is safe. No loading spinners that create uncertainty.

6. **Mature Gamification** - Loyalty points and celebrations that feel adult, not childish. David's test: would an accountant use this without embarrassment?

### Design Opportunities

1. **Safe Zone as Brand Signature** - Ambient glow showing budget status is unique in the market. Competitors show numbers; Oja shows *feeling*.

2. **Liquid Animation System** - Stock levels that drain like containers create visceral satisfaction. Updates feel good instead of obligatory.

3. **Pre-Shop Confidence** - Running total before leaving home is the killer feature. No competitor offers "know your total before you shop."

4. **Quiet Celebration Philosophy** - Brief confetti (1 second, muted colors, fades quickly) creates premium feel. Victory is acknowledged, not announced.

5. **Community Contribution Feedback** - "Your prices helped 12 shoppers this month" creates belonging without leaderboards or competition.

---

## Core User Experience

### Defining Experience

The core Oja experience is the **in-store shopping loop**: checking off items while watching the budget respond in real-time. This interaction must feel instant (<100ms) and satisfying. If users don't feel in control during this loop, the entire product fails.

**Core Loop:**
```
Pantry (Out) → Shopping List → In-Store Checkout → Receipt Scan → Pantry (Stocked)
```

Each stage flows naturally into the next. Stock running out creates the list. The list guides shopping. Shopping creates receipts. Receipts update stock and prices. The cycle reinforces itself.

### Platform Strategy (v2 Update)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Platform | **Native Mobile (Expo)** | Better performance, native feel, platform-adaptive UI |
| Primary Input | Touch | In-store, one-handed use |
| Offline | 100% Core Features | Store connectivity is unreliable |
| Camera | Native Camera API | Receipt scanning with better quality |
| Location | Optional | Store detection, not required |
| Touch Targets | 44x44px minimum | Accessibility, thumb-friendly |
| Haptics | Comprehensive | Tactile feedback for all interactions |

**Shopping Mode:** When user begins checking items, interface adapts:
- Larger touch targets
- Budget bar more prominent
- Simplified actions (check/uncheck focus)
- Auto-mute option in detected stores

### Effortless Interactions

**Automated:**
- "Out" stock items → automatically added to next list
- Trip completion → stock levels reset to "Stocked"
- Cross-device sync → happens invisibly
- Shopping Mode → activates based on context

**One-Tap:**
- Check/uncheck items
- Confirm AI-parsed receipt
- Accept budget suggestion
- Dismiss celebrations

**Gesture-Based:**
- Swipe left/right → change item priority
- Tap-and-hold → change stock level
- Pull-to-refresh → manual sync (rarely needed)

### Critical Success Moments

| Moment | Target User | Success Indicator |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Under-budget checkout | Sarah | Brief celebration, feels empowered not deprived |
| Onboarding complete | Marcus | <90 seconds, feels "ready to shop" |
| Receipt scan works | Priya | Camera to confirmed items <10 seconds |
| Error recovery | James | Clear path forward, no dead ends |
| Monthly review | David | Clean data, no forced celebration |

### Experience Principles

1. **Budget Visibility, Not Anxiety** - Safe Zone glow is supportive, not judgmental

2. **Instant Feedback, Always** - Every interaction produces immediate response (<100ms for budget)

3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple for new users, powerful for experts

4. **Offline-First Confidence** - No spinners, no waiting, it just works

5. **Celebration Without Cringe** - Brief, muted, adult-appropriate feedback

## Desired Emotional Response

### Primary Emotional Goals

**Core Feeling:** In control, confident, empowered - but never restricted or deprived.

Users should feel like they've gained a superpower: knowing their total before checkout. The anxiety that comes from uncertainty should be replaced by calm confidence.

**The Moment That Creates Advocates:**
Walking out of a store under budget and feeling *good* about it - not like they sacrificed, but like they succeeded.

### Emotional Journey Mapping

| Stage | Before Oja | With Oja |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Pre-shopping | Anxiety, uncertainty | Confidence, preparedness |
| In-store | Stress, mental math | Control, visibility |
| Checkout | Dread, hope | Calm expectation |
| Post-shopping | Regret or relief | Accomplishment |
| Long-term | Hopelessness | Measurable progress |

### Micro-Emotions

**Positive emotions to cultivate:**
- Reassurance (Safe Zone green)
- Alertness without panic (Safe Zone amber)
- Problem-solving mode (Safe Zone red)
- Satisfaction (stock updates, item checks)
- Quiet pride (under-budget completion)
- Trust (offline reliability)
- Belonging (community contribution)

**Negative emotions to prevent:**
- Shame (budget exceeded)
- Overwhelm (feature overload)
- Embarrassment (childish gamification)
- Distrust (sync uncertainty)
- Deprivation (budget as cage)
- Nagging (excessive notifications)

### Design Implications

| Emotion Goal | Design Decision |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Confidence | Budget always visible, instant updates |
| Control | User sets all limits, never auto-adjusted |
| Satisfaction | Tactile animations, subtle sounds |
| Progress | Data presentation, not grades or scores |
| Trust | Offline-first, no loading spinners |
| Calm | Warm palette, soft animations |

### Emotional Design Principles

1. **Support, Never Judge** - Helpful friend tone, not disapproving parent
2. **Celebrate Quietly** - Acknowledge wins without fanfare
3. **Visibility Builds Confidence** - Show status constantly, update instantly
4. **Graceful Failure** - Easy recovery, no dead ends
5. **Reliability Earns Trust** - Works offline, syncs invisibly

## Defining Experience Deep Dive

### The Core Interaction

**"Check off items and watch your budget respond in real-time."**

This is the Tinder-swipe moment for Oja. The defining action users will describe to friends: *"I know my total before I reach the checkout."*

Like Tinder reduced dating to a simple gesture, Oja reduces budget anxiety to a single visual feedback loop: tap item → see budget change → feel in control. If we nail this interaction, everything else follows.

### User Mental Model

**How Users Currently Solve This:**
- Mental math while shopping (exhausting, inaccurate)
- Paper lists with price estimates (tedious, quickly forgotten)
- Checking basket total at checkout (anxiety-inducing surprise)
- Existing apps as glorified notepads (no budget awareness)

**The Mental Model Shift:**
| Before Oja | With Oja |
|------------|----------|
| Shopping lists are passive | Lists talk back with budget |
| Budget discovered at checkout | Budget known in real-time |
| Price tracking is tedious | Price learning is automatic |
| Overspending is failure | Budget status is visible control |

**Potential Confusion Points:**
- Safe Zone glow needs instant recognition without tutorial
- Price estimate accuracy must build trust quickly
- Red zone must support decision-making, not induce shame

### Success Criteria for Core Experience

| Criterion | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Check-off response | <100ms | Instant feels magical; any delay feels broken |
| Budget comprehension | <2 seconds | Glance at Safe Zone = instant status understanding |
| First-time glow recognition | 90%+ | New users understand Safe Zone without explanation |
| Total accuracy | ±£2 or 85%+ | Estimates must be close enough to build confidence |
| Emotional outcome | Calm, not anxious | Safe Zone reduces stress, never creates it |

**Success Indicators:**
- User checks item and immediately glances at budget (feedback loop working)
- User says "I can afford one more thing" with confidence (control achieved)
- User reaches checkout within predicted range (trust established)
- User shows friend the Safe Zone glow (advocacy moment created)

### Novel UX Patterns

**Established Patterns Adopted:**
- Checkbox lists (universal understanding)
- Bottom tab navigation (thumb-zone familiar)
- Pull-to-refresh (learned behaviour)
- Card-based layouts (scannable, modern)
- Swipe gestures (priority changes)

**The Safe Zone Innovation:**
Unlike competitors showing numbers, Oja shows *feeling* through ambient glow:

| Zone | Colour | Meaning | User Feeling |
|------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Safe | Green | Well under budget | Confidence, freedom |
| Caution | Amber | Approaching limit | Alertness, mindfulness |
| Over | Red | Budget exceeded | Decision mode (not shame) |

**Familiar Metaphor:** Traffic lights - everyone understands green/amber/red. But instead of harsh indicators, ambient glows make the screen itself breathe the budget status.

**Learning Method:** Onboarding dial sets budget with instant Safe Zone preview. Users learn by experiencing, not reading tutorials.

### Experience Mechanics

**Initiation:**
- App opens → shopping list with budget bar always visible
- Safe Zone glow subtly colours background
- "Shopping Mode" auto-activates when checking begins or store detected
- Touch targets enlarge, interface simplifies

**Interaction:**
- Primary action: Tap checkbox (44x44px minimum)
- Item slides to checked state with satisfying animation
- Budget ring animates simultaneously (<100ms)
- Safe Zone colour adjusts in real-time

**Feedback System:**
| Type | Implementation | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Visual | Budget ring fills, Safe Zone shifts | Primary feedback |
| Haptic | Subtle vibration on round numbers | Milestone awareness |
| Audio | Optional soft tick (user-controlled) | Confirmation |
| Numerical | Running total animates | Precision for data-focused users |

**Completion Flow:**
1. All items checked → "Trip Complete" prompt
2. Under budget → Brief confetti (1 second, muted, adult-appropriate)
3. Receipt scan prompt appears
4. Stock levels auto-reset to "Stocked"

**Error Recovery:**
- Accidental tap → Easy undo (tap again or shake)
- Over budget → Supportive message: "Let's review what's important"
- Connection loss → Full offline function, invisible later sync
- Incorrect item → Swipe to edit or remove

- High contrast mode with increased saturation
- rem-based typography for user scaling
- 2px orange focus indicators
- Safe Zone icons paired with colours (never colour-only)
- Screen reader announcements for budget status changes

## Design Direction Decision

### Design Directions Explored

Six comprehensive design directions were created and evaluated:

1. **Card-Heavy Layout** - Prominent cards, clear visual hierarchy, contained sections
2. **Minimal Clean** - Maximum white space, budget-dominant display, calm aesthetic
3. **Dashboard Focus** - Metrics-forward, priority indicators, data-rich interface
4. **List-Centric** - Sticky budget, drag handles, category groups, efficient scrolling
5. **Visual/Illustrated** - Category cards with icons, warm and inviting, playful elements
6. **Compact/Dense** - Information-dense, tab filtering, power-user optimized

Each direction applied the established design foundation (orange brand, Safe Zone system, warm aesthetic) in different ways to explore layout, density, and interaction approaches.

**Design Direction Visualizer:** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-directions.html`

### Chosen Direction

**Primary: Card-Heavy Layout (Direction 1)** with adaptive elements

This direction was selected as the foundation because it:
- Provides clear visual hierarchy without overwhelming new users
- Features Safe Zone glow prominently as ambient background
- Uses budget ring for instant status comprehension
- Balances friendliness (Sarah, James) with structure (Priya, David)
- Maintains warm, supportive aesthetic aligned with emotional goals

**Adaptive Elements Incorporated:**
- Sticky budget bar (from Direction 4) activates in Shopping Mode
- Tab filtering (from Direction 6) available for power users
- Category grouping (from Direction 4) as optional organization view

### Design Rationale

| Persona | How This Direction Serves Them |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Sarah (Anxious) | Cards feel contained and manageable, not overwhelming |
| Marcus (Sceptical) | Clean enough to feel simple, structured enough to trust |
| Priya (Power User) | Sticky budget + tabs give efficiency without changing core |
| James (Tech-Struggling) | Large touch targets, clear boundaries, forgiving UX |
| David (Data-Focused) | Budget ring shows clean data, no forced celebration |

**Safe Zone Integration:**
- Ambient background glow (15% opacity) creates emotional context
- Budget ring in header provides precise numeric feedback
- Both work together: feeling (glow) + data (ring)

### Implementation Approach

**Core Layout Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Header: Greeting + Budget Ring │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Safe Zone Glow (background)    │
│  ┌───────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Card: Shopping List      │  │
│  │  - Item rows with checks  │  │
│  └───────────────────────────┘  │
│  ┌───────────────────────────┐  │
│  │  Card: Running Low        │  │
│  └───────────────────────────┘  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Bottom Navigation (4 tabs)     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Shopping Mode Adaptation:**
- Sticky budget bar appears at top
- Touch targets enlarge to 48px+
- Cards simplify to check/uncheck focus
- Safe Zone glow becomes more prominent

**Component Priorities:**
1. BudgetRing - Circular progress with Safe Zone colors
2. SafeZoneGlow - Animated background effect
3. ItemCard - Checkable list item with price
4. StickyBudgetBar - Compact budget display for scrolling

## UX Consistency Patterns

### Budget Feedback Patterns

**Safe Zone System:**
| Status | Color | Trigger | Message Tone |
|--------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Safe | Green #10B981 | <80% budget | "You're on track" |

## Responsive Design & Accessibility

### Responsive Strategy

**Device Priority:** Mobile (P0) → Tablet (P1) → Desktop (P2)

**Mobile (Primary):** Full-featured, bottom tabs, single column, 44px touch targets.
**Tablet:** Scaled mobile layout, larger spacing.
**Desktop:** Max-width 480px centered, mobile-app feel.

### Breakpoint Strategy

| Breakpoint | Range | Target |
|------------|-------|--------|
| `xs` | 0-374px | Small phones |
| `sm` | 375-767px | Standard phones (primary) |
| `md` | 768-1023px | Tablets |
| `lg` | 1024px+ | Desktop |

**Approach:** Mobile-first CSS, same layout constrained on larger screens.

### Accessibility Strategy

**Target:** WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

**Key Requirements:**
- Color contrast: 4.5:1 (normal), 3:1 (large)
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum
- Keyboard: Full navigation support
- Screen reader: ARIA labels, live regions
- Safe Zone: Icons + color (never color alone)
- Reduced motion: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Safe Zone Accessibility:**
| Visual | Alternative |
|--------|-------------|
| Green glow | ✓ icon + "Budget safe" |
| Amber glow | ⚠ icon + "Budget caution" |
| Red glow | ✕ icon + "Over budget" |

### Testing Strategy

**Responsive:** DevTools (every PR), real devices (weekly), BrowserStack (pre-release).
**Accessibility:** axe-core in CI, VoiceOver/NVDA testing, keyboard-only validation.

**Priority Devices:** iPhone 13+, Samsung Galaxy S21+, iPad, Desktop Chrome/Safari.

### Implementation Guidelines

**Responsive:**
- Mobile-first Platform-adaptive styling classes
- Relative units (rem, %)
- Max-width 480px on desktop

**Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA roles and labels
- Focus management
- Skip links
- Live regions for dynamic content
